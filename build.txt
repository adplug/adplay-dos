AdPlay/DOS Build Requirements
-----------------------------
To compile AdPlay/DOS from source, you need DJGPP.
DJGPP can be downloaded from http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/.

AdPlay/DOS depends on the following libraries:

Name and version:
-----------------
AdPlug >= 1.1
DJGPP Timer Library >= 1.0, when using DJGPP
Portable Textmode Window Class Library >= 1.1

All these libraries can be fetched from http://adplug.github.io/.

Build Instructions
------------------
Please read one of the INSTALL.* files for further build
instructions. There is one for each supported architecture.

Debug logging the AdPlug core library with AdPlay/DOS
-----------------------------------------------------
If you compiled the AdPlug core library with debug logging support enabled,
AdPlay/DOS automatically redirects the output from the default 'stderr' to a
file called 'debug.log' in the directory, it was started from. This is to
prevent screen cluttering, which would otherwise occur when AdPlug is logging
directly to the console, on which AdPlay/DOS has its GUI output.

Debug logging AdPlay/DOS
------------------------
To enable debug logging, you have to define the DEBUG preprocessor
variable. Plase refer to the manual of your respective architecture
for information on how to do this.

This instructs all source files to generate debug logging output. The output
goes to different logfiles by default. Please refer to the source code for
information on the file names.
