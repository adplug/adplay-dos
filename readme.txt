AdPlay/DOS 1.6, Copyright (c) 2000 - 2006 Simon Peter <dn.tlp@gmx.net>
Website: http://adplug.github.io

Description:
------------
AdPlay is AdPlug's MS-DOS based frontend. Sporting an exclusively programmed
textmode interface, it provides a convenient playback experience. AdPlay
requires an installed OPL2 audio board for song replay. No emulated playback
is supported.

Supported formats:
------------------
AdPlug implements unique file replayers for each supported format in order to
achieve the best possible replay quality. Below is a list of all currently
supported file formats along with information about possible replay issues.

Usage:
------
AdPlay is normally started without any commandline parameters, bringing it
into interactive mode where you select the files to play using a file selector
within a graphical user interface. Select files using the Up/Down cursor keys
and press enter to start playback. F1 will bring up a help window, explaining
all other available key functions.

It is possible to invoke AdPlay in background playback mode, which will turn
it into a console background playback utility. Use the '-b <file>' commandline
parameter to start AdPlay in this way, replacing <file> with the desired file
to be played back.

You can also invoke AdPlay in the so called batch mode. This turns it into a
console playback utility where each file will be played back until it ends.
After the last file has been played back, the program will exit. Use the
'-q <files...>' option to start AdPlay in this way, giving it as many files
as you like.

Other interesting parameters are the '-f' and '-c' options, which will load
another configuration file and/or section. You can stack up as many of these
parameters, as you like. For example, use '-c lowres -c monochrome' to turn
the interface to low resolution mode, in monochrome. With any new
configuration file loaded, the 'default' section of that file will always be
processed first.

To get a list with short descriptions of all available commandline parameters
in AdPlay, use the '-?' or '-h' commandline options. All options can be set
with '-' or '/' respectively.

Configuration:
--------------
AdPlay can be configured through the configuration file "adplay.ini", which
should be placed inside AdPlay's program directory. You can refer to the
default adplay.ini file for help on how to create your own configuration
scheme. Add more configuation schemes by adding a new section. The file works
much in a way like a standard Microsoft INI file.

Known Problems:
---------------
Returning from a DOS shell in a Windows 95 DOS Box will destroy the sound.
