Build notes
-----------
- DJGPP is the only supported GCC architecture right now.

- Please use Makefile

- There are four Makefile targets:
  - The default target builds the library
  - 'clean' cleans the source tree of all built files
  - 'dist' makes a distribution archive
  - 'install' installs the library into the hierarchy under $(prefix),
    which is defined in the Makefile
